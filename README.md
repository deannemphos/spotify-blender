# spotify-blender
Takes your currently playing + last played song on Spotify and blends the album covers either down the middle or as an overlay.
Also has some image transforms just because they're fun so you can flip the corners and halves as you wish.

Super rough Python album cover blender made for output to LED matrix on a Raspberry Pi. Pretty much just a dumb little apartment project to use to learn Python and the comments are mostly made for Tom to know what I was doing.

Output is NOT in this version, final was made in Thonny on my Raspberry Pi for setting up the GPIO and I'll have to go grab those files at some point.
