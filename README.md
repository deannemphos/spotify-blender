# spotify-blender
Super rough Python album cover blender made for output to LED matrix on a Raspberry Pi. Pretty much just a dumb little apartment project to use to learn Python and the comments are mostly made for Tom to know what I was doing.

Output is NOT in this version, final was made in Thonny on my Raspberry Pi for setting up the GPIO and I'll have to go grab those files at some point.
